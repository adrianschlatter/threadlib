# Creating Thread Specs

In the following, we explain how a thread spec (i.e., an entry in THREAD_TABLE) is created. First, we will explain the basics of threads and how they are specified in the norms. Then, we will ellaborate on the specifics to translate those into threadlib thread specs.


## Thread Basics


To do this, we use British Standard Pipe parallel (BSPP) thread as an example (see drawing below). The bold curve shows the parting line between internal and external thread. In an ideal world, both threads are created according to the parting line. The parting line of BSP thread is based on a fundamental triangle with a 55-degree angle rounded to a radius r.

Reality is a bit more complicated: If one of the threads deviates only a little in the wrong direction, the threads collide. Therefore, the pitch radius r_pitch (radius where distance between falling and rising edges is exactly P/2) of the external thread has to be reduced a little bit (and vice versa for the internal thread). Also, major and minor radii are adjusted so that the real thread is guaranteed to remain on its own side of the theoretical parting line.

Of course, it is not ok to introduce arbitrarily large allowances: The norm (BS EN ISO 228-1: 2003 in this case) gives the necessary constraints. Quoting [Maryland Metrics thread data charts for BSP thread](http://mdmetric.com/tech/thddat7.htm):

## Deriving threadlib Specs

To simplify the thread profile, we want to avoid the rounding and replace it by a trapezoidal edge as shown in here (red: internal, blue external thread): 

![threadlib profile compared to BSP parting line](imgs/BSPthread.jpg)
 
It is clear that we have to match the pitch as accurately as possible.  Therefore, threadlibs P is equal to the pitch in the norm (for G1/16: 0.907 mm).

Then, we choose the pitch diameter to be in the center of the given tolerance range. For G1/16 this is (7.723 + 0.107/2) mm. 

To explain the choice of r_major and r_minor for both external and internal threads simultaneously, we use the terms r_crest and r_valley. r_crest is the major/minor radius (external/internal) and r_valley is the minor/major radius (external/internal). The norm does not give limits for r_valley. But threadlib requires that the threadprofile covers *less* than 1 pitch of thread. Therefore, we arbitrarily choose a small but finite width of "valley floor" that leaves ample clearance to the parting line. For r_crest, we to take into account

a) the allowed deviations given in the norm
b) the rounding (that we want to leave away)

The former is simple: We aim for the center. The latter requires a little math: We want our piecewise linear profile to remain on one side of the (true) BSP profile. Therefore, our crest radius has to be equal to the radius where the straight rising edge of the BSP profile touches the circle of the rounding.


## Adding Specs to threadlib

To get the threads into threadlib, we currently do the following: 

- Add csv-file with original thread specs in design (e.g., "newthreads.csv")
- Write an awk script (e.g., design/newthreads.awk) that translates this .csv file to tabular threadlib specs
- Modify Makefile: Add a line like "cat design/newthreads.csv | awk -f design/newthreads.awk >> design/THREAD_TABLE.csv")
- design/autogenerate.awk will translate the resulting THREAD_TABLE.csv into the final THREAD_TABLE.scad (same as the .csv but with added quoting and bracketing).

Furthermore, we should extend tests/test_table.awk to test our newly created threads. The very minimum is to add a test for the thread angles. Perform the tests by running 'make test' in the top-level directory or 'make' inside the tests subdirectory. If it prints "TESTS SUCCESSFUL" you are probably fine. Note: If you have a thread spec that is not tested at all, the tests will fail, too.
